week vs day problem, the weeks weren't in order and there were a lot of games that were made up
issues with ties
new teams entering the league
teams at the top dominating, had to adjust sov function

manual data entry for late 2019 because source didn't work

basically no variable I change has a noticeable affect on the accuracy of the model

try to get autocorrelation working, model doesn't work in 50/50 cases and that's where it needs to work the best 

changing of K
changing of threshold to decide when to best
contact enetodds
bet/not bet if book is >75

add home_advantage

still to check what happens to a team after it's been out for a while. 

ELO end of seasons seem to match. 

did tuning and found out k just needed to be positive
this means sov is useless, need to find a way to make it better

not overfitting because kind of constant

9% of matches are ties
100-10% = 90%, 

basically always losing on 10% of matches

see if there's a way to remove teams if they don't appear again from the graphs
that way there isn't a random line through the data


HSN Nordhorn exists in the odds, but I don't ahve it bc no data for 2019 and 2020. 
HSG Nordhorn-Lingen

merging but the names of teams were different
got that fixed
